# airbnb-market_analysis

Savvy real estate investors have been leveraging the short-term rental business model of Airbnb for years. As restrictions on this market have tightened, however, investors must make informed decisions to profit from their home rentals. This project focused on analysis of the Airbnb market in Broward County, Florida, an ocean-side community with 18,000+ short term rentals. The objective of this analysis was two-fold:  

1) Identify the most important property attributes affecting property daily listing price 
2) Recommend the ideal investment location within the Broward county area to maximize yearly revenue  

The dataset was sourced from [insideairnbnb.com](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), an open-source website containing data scraped directly from Airbnb's website.
